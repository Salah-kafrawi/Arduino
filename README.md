### Arduino Projects
I worked on data collection, data analysis, data visualization, IoT architecture, MQTT communication, and dashboard implementations in Taibah Valley IoT lab. Also, I co-worked on a data collecting module for water bottles distribution system as the final project in the internship, The project is based on IoT and computer vision (YOLOv4) to make data collection process easier and straightforward.
Also, these projects aim to make the user more fimiliar with the Arduino and the ESP enivronments.
